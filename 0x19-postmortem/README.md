This postmortem provides an overview of an unexpected service degradation that occurred, impacting the user authentication service. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration introduced during a recent deployment, which led to degraded performance. The issue was resolved by rolling back the problematic deployment and implementing code optimizations. Corrective measures were proposed to improve testing processes, monitoring, and code review practices to prevent similar incidents in the future.
